# The code below uses Bing search to find the results to query/question asked by the user.
# The results from Bing are then fed into the LLM model to generate the answer.
# We are not relying on OpenAIs ability to find the answer, instead we are doing the heavy lifting of searching for the answer on Bing
# The drawback of this approach is that for complex questions or multiple questions in one sentence, the answer may not be as we are solely relying on Bing search and not breaking it down
